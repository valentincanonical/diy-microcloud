# #3 Cluster the machines with LXD: your first cloud

_Expected duration: 15mn_

This section is where we get to build our first cloud capabilities. We will cluster the physical (or, for our demo, virtual) machines together, abstracting them as a virtual layer capable of providing both Linux containers and virtual machines.
We will then have virtual machines from almost any Linux distribution available no more than one command away. (If you're a more advanced user, [read more on how to get Windows VMs with LXD](https://github.com/lxc/distrobuilder#repack-windows-iso).)

Abstracting away from the bare metal layer is a practical step to building automated, scalable, and modular micro clouds. You may wonder why we don't just go directly with the K8s layer (and you could do it), so here's what you get with the additional LXD virtualisation layer:

- **Increased security**: Machine containers provide better protection than K8s containers to keep your workloads confined.
- **Multi-tenancy**: In some situations, you might need more than one K8s cluster on the same micro cloud - don't shut any door now.
- **Flexibility**: Adding and removing physical nodes has never been easier. With LXD, you can [move containers/virtual machines](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/manpages/man1/lxc-copy.1.html) between physical nodes.
- **High-availability**: LXD adds a layer of resiliency to failures and outages with built-in high availability from 3 nodes and above.
- **Simplified operations**: The more you can abstract, the more you will standardise and automate remote management operations.

## Option A: Build your private LXD cloud in one Juju command

Thanks to Model Driven Operations, deploying and operating software is automated and repeatable; two key qualities for edge deployments.
Here's how to use the [LXD Charmed Operator](https://github.com/canonical/charm-lxd) to deploy and configure your micro cloud LXD cluster in one command.

<!-- TODO: remove section once official charm is available. -->
### Download the LXD Charm

```sh
$ multipass shell juju

# For ARM64 users
ubuntu@juju:~$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valentincanonical/diy-microcloud/main/precompiled/lxd_ubuntu-20.04-arm64.charm -O lxd_ubuntu-20.04.charm

# For AMD64 users
ubuntu@juju:~$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valentincanonical/diy-microcloud/main/precompiled/lxd_ubuntu-20.04-amd64.charm -O lxd_ubuntu-20.04.charm

# For Rapsberry Pi ARM64 users
TODO file for Rpi users
```

You can also compile it yourself for your platform (click to expand the instructions).
    </summary>

```sh
    # on a new, clean machine
    git clone -b cluster https://github.com/simondeziel/charm-lxd.git
    sudo snap install charmcraft --classic
    sudo lxd init --auto
    cd ./charm-lxd
    charmcraft build
```

### Deploy the LXD Charm

One command to deploy and configure your LXD cluster with Juju and the [LXD machine charm](https://charmhub.io/lxd):
```sh
ubuntu@juju:~$ juju deploy ./lxd_ubuntu-20.04.charm lxd -n 3 --to 0,1,2 --config mode=cluster
```

Grab a cocktail 🍹 while you watch Juju deploy and configure everything for you:
```sh
# Wait for the App and Workload statuses to be 'active'
ubuntu@juju:~$ watch --color juju status --color
Model    Controller    Cloud/Region  Version  SLA 
default  bare-default  bare/default  2.9.14   unsupported

2        started  192.168.64.32  manual:192.168.64.32  focal       Manually provisioned machine
```

## Option B: Manually configure LXD cluster

If you want to see what is happening under the hood, you can manually configure LXD on each node and cluster them together. We recommend using the Juju option to save you some time and uncover the power of Charmed Operators, but you're also good to go with this option.
